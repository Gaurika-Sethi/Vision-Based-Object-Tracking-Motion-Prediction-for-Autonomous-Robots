# Vision-Based Object Tracking and Motion Prediction

**Goal**  
Build a computer vision system that detects and tracks a moving object in a video and predicts its future position using a Kalman Filter and Optical Flow.

**Why this project?**  
- Highly relevant to robotics and autonomous navigation  
- Used in DRDO (CHESS, ASL, ANURAG)  
- Matches research areas in IITs and IIITs  
- Purely vision + motion prediction — no hardware required  

**Final Output**  
- Detected object with bounding box  
- Trajectory visualization  
- Kalman filter predictions  
- Error analysis plots  

**Tech Stack**  
- Python, OpenCV  
- Kalman Filter  
- Optical Flow (Lucas–Kanade)
